# Al_Bundy_Inventory_Management

Al Bundy is a US based company that has been established 30 years ago Currently, it also operates in Canada, the UK and Germany. The firm sells mid to high end shoes ranging from one hundred and twenty to two hundred dollars.

While the shoes are of high quality, you have lots and lots of inventory that is never sold. In other words, the shoes collect dust on store shelves Inventory management is a very common problem, many, if not most, shops cannot determine the right number of items they need to keep in stock.

The opposite problem arises to shops don't supply an adequate amount of goods and fail to meet the demand in their market. For instance, you have surely entered a shoe shop, but we're unable to buy a specific pair of shoes because they did not have them in stock in this example. We will examine the opposite problem, having too much inventory.

This is a more significant problem for the company as it means the company has invested in producing or purchasing the product but was not able to sell it.
